# Mobile Implementation of AnimeGANv2


This project is a wrapper of the base model made by @TachibanaYoshino [AnimeGANv2](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGANv2) and the weighted face model by @bryandlee [
animegan2-pytorch](https://github.com/bryandlee/animegan2-pytorch).

This project differs from commercial applications such as [PREQUEL](https://www.prequel.app/) because the images are processed locally/natively in the device itself rather than through backend server.
